                            Mortgage Lenders Handbook Tracker is a quick and easy way to track and keep a record of all the changes that are made to Part 2 of the UK Finance Handbook. 
                            It will instantly alert you whenever a new update is made by a lender. 
                            All you need to do is sign up and select the required Region and Lender. 
                            Once you subscribe to the MLH tracker, you will get email alerts in the registered email. 
                            Whenever a lender makes an update, you will be able to see what changes have been made to Part 2 (lender-specific instructions) and when it was last updated.

                        It is essential to have a process in place to confirm that a fee earner has reviewed Part 2 of the UK Finance Handbook to determine both the standard requirements of the lender and those particular to the transaction and to validate that all such requirements have been met before the exchange takes place. 
                        Additionally, a procedure for documenting that the review has been completed and recorded in the file is crucial.
                        <br>
                        As you know, all CQS accredited Conveyancing practices must have a policy and procedure to ensure that you are compliant with the aforementioned requirement.
